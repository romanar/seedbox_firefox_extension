Xirvik's seedbox extension for Firefox

Notes:
- Yes, we know it's not working perfectly yet. We released it really early so it was available as soon as FireFox Quantum was released, knowing that the existing extensions wouldn't work anymore. The idea was to get people to play with it as soon as possible so it would be rock solid as soon as possible, but as often happens, all reports came after the Quantum release. So well, final users are actually beta testing the extension.
- Please report bugs using the "Issues" tab in GitHub.
- Feature requests also go to "Issues".
- For support (not bugs) you can just email us. If you're a Xirvik users you'll get priority as you'd expect, otherwise we'll reply as soon as possible as time allows. But to be clear, we do support this extension for everyone.
- Keep in mind that some support questions just have to be directed to your service provider, not us. We won't be able to tell you the correct URLs to connect, for example.

Enjoy.
